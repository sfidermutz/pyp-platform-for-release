  "narrative": "Commercial and military traffic transiting the Estera Approaches, a narrow northern-littoral choke point, report intermittent navigation drift, degraded Automatic Identification System (AIS) fidelity, and bursts of false channel markers on open-source maritime feeds. Local authorities are divided: some attribute anomalies to aging infrastructure; others believe an adversary is probing Alliance responses below the threshold of conflict. A coordinated online narrative questions coalition competence, pressuring political leaders to \"restore order\" quickly. Energy resupply vessels are 24 hours out, and maritime insurance rates for the corridor have begun climbing. As the Joint Task Group’s J5 planner, you must shape an initial posture that balances physical, virtual, and cognitive effects while avoiding premature escalation.",
